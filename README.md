# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Data Analysis of Kickstarters to find trends for Lousie to plan her fundraiser to be successful
1. Data filters that there were 525 successful theater Kickstarters in the United States
2. We have found that while there are only a total of 604 Kickstarter campaigns for plays in Great Britain, the "theater" category is the most successful.    The chart below shows the findings:

3. May was the month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns. However, January, June, July and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched. These findings are shown in the line chart below:

## Based on the statistics finding of the data, we can determine the following:

1. The mean of each distribution is around the 3rd quartile, so the data follows similar distributions in each subset
2. The standard deviations are larger than the mean, which means everything below the mean is considered "close" to the center
3. Some large values are driving all of these distributions. The standard deviations are all roughly twice the IQR in each distribution, except in the failed Kickstarters, where the standard deviation is closer to three times the IQR. There must be some failed Kickstarters with really high goals!

Accordinng to the Kickstarters Data analysis, Louise should start her fundraising campaign in early May as most successful compaigns started in May.  Most realistic goals should be set closer to the 3rd quartile to ensure similar distributions in each subset.
